## Please, behave
From the feature specs we can observe some important information regarding interactions:
  1. list item selection is toggled when clicked.
  1. the list group works with single selection of list items.

The second point was not explicit from the specs (and it was intentional so that you could comment on it. Did you see it?) but we discovered it after some (imaginary) team discussion (backlog grooming, pre-iteration meeting, etc). Even though the team communicates and writes a lot in preparation for the implementation, many specs questions will rise when the code gets written specially in the early stages of development. As the team knowledge of the product/feature and technical details grows, they can foresee more cases and make sure the specs are not missing anything critical. Effective communication is key!

With that in the clear, it's time to start coding the main funcionality of the feature/app. We're going to follow the [Container component pattern](https://reactpatterns.com/#container-component) for separating the data fetching from the rendering/behavior. Let's start with the latter with the `<RepositoryIssuesBrowser>` component.

Just to shorten up a bit this post, here's the whole component test without its implementation:

```
describe("<RepositoryIssuesBrowser />", () => {

  it("renders a loading indicator when loading prop is truthy", () => {});

  describe("when repository data is available", () => {
    it("shows a list of repository names", () => {});

    it("shows a summary of all open issues", () => {});

    describe("and there are open issues in a repo", () => {
      it("shows the count of opened issues next to the repo name", () => {});
    });

    describe('and when a repo is clicked', () => {

      describe('and it is NOT selected', () => {
        it('selects the clicked item', () => {});

        it('deselects any other selected item - single selection', () => {});
      });

      describe('and it IS selected', () => {
        it('deselects the clicked item', () => {});
      });
    });

    describe('when a repository with open issues is selected', () => {
      it('shows its list of issues', () => {});
    });
  });
});
```

But now it's the tricky part: *implement the tests in a way that it's not coupled with the component's implementation.* This is important because we want to be able to refactor our code in ways that better suit the implementation needs *without* having to modify any of its tests. Attention: if the public API changes, that's not a refactor! Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior.

Here's a test implementation that follows our guidelines. **Red:**

```
/**
* @param {string} text 
* @param {ReactWrapper<any>} wrapper - an instance of `ReactWrapper` generated by `mount`.
* @returns Returns the first element from the given wrapper that has text that matches the given text.
*/
function findByText(text:string, wrapper:ReactWrapper<any>): ReactWrapper<any> {
  return wrapper.findWhere(
    n => n.text() === text
  ).first();
}

describe("<RepositoryIssuesBrowser />", () => {
  describe("when repository data is available", () => {
    it("shows a list of repository names", () => {
      const repos = [{ name: "Repo 1" }, { name: "Repo 2" }];
      const wrapper = mount(<RepositoryIssuesBrowser repositories={repos} />);

      expect(findByText("Repo 1", wrapper)).toExist();
      expect(findByText("Repo 2", wrapper)).toExist();
    });
  });
});
```

We have to use `mount` because we don't know yet how the component is implemented so the string we're looking for might be somewhere down the render tree.
Let's also practice the theory we have learned so far, starting with rule #1: *You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.*
The minimal implementation to make it *green*:

```
// src/components/repositoryIssuesBrowser.js
// @flow

export default function RepositoryIssuesBrowser({ repositories: any } : any) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Repo 1</div>
      <div>Repo 2</div>
    </div>
  )
};
```
It seems a bit dumb, right? But this is only the beginning a cool TDD cycle. Rule #2 states: *You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.* so we can re-write the tests in a more clever way that forces the correct usage of the given repositories props. **Red:**

```
type Repository = {
  name: string
};

/**
  * @returns a `Repository[]` with random length between 1 and 9.
  */
function getRandomRepos() : Repository[] {
  const rand = Math.max(1, Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));
  return return Array(rand).fill(rand).map((v:number, i:number) => ({ name: `Repo${v} - ${i}` }));
}

it("shows a list of repository names", () => {
  const repos:Repository[] = getRandomRepos();
  const wrapper = mount(<RepositoryIssuesBrowser repositories={repos} />);

  repos.forEach( (repo:Repository) => {
    expect(findByText(repo.name, wrapper)).toExist();
  });
});
```

Now, the easiest implementation is the correct one. **Green:**

```
// Moved the Repository type definition to where it belongs and make it public (export).
export type Repository = {
  name: string
};

type RepositoryIssuesBrowserProps = {
  repositories: Repository[]
};

export default function RepositoryIssuesBrowser({ repositories }: RepositoryIssuesBrowserProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      {
        repositories.map((repo, idx) => <div key={idx}>{repo.name}</div>)
      }
    </div>
  )
};
```

Before we move any further with the tests, let's check our progress in the browser with a new story:

```
// src/stories/index.js
import RepositoryIssuesBrowser from "../components/repositoryIssuesBrowser";

storiesOf("RepositoryIssuesBrowser", module)
  .add("with repositories", () => {
    const repos = [{ name: "Repo 1" }, { name: "Repo 2" }];
    return <RepositoryIssuesBrowser repositories={repos} />;
  });
```

Now you should be seeing something 
















Here's an example of a perfectly valid test case which's implementation is coupled with the components private parts:

```
it("shows a list of repository names", () => {
  const repos: Repository[] = [{ name: "Repo 1" }, { name: "Repo 2" }];
  const wrapper = mount(<RepositoryIssuesBrowser repositories={repos} />);

  // Uh oh! How do I know <ListGroupItem> internally by <RepositoryIssuesBrowser>?!
  const item1 = wrapper.find('ListGroupItem').first();
  expect(item1).toHaveText("Repo 1");

  // What happens if <RepositoryIssuesBrowser> is refactored and stops using <ListGroupItem>?
  const item2 = wrapper.find('ListGroupItem').last();
  expect(item2).toHaveText("Repo 2");
});
```

The code comments above says it all: knowing that `<RepositoryIssuesBrowser>` uses `<ListGroupItem>` internally is a violation the Black-box testing. Writting tests like this is also testing its implementation details. Tests should not care about implementation details. The list of repository names should be rendered and the tests doesn't care how!
